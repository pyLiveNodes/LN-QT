# LN QT

The Livenodes QT package provides interaction and visualization nodes. Most notably online annotation and display of any channels data.

[LiveNodes](https://livenodes.pages.csl.uni-bremen.de/livenodes/index.html) are small units of computation for digital signal processing in python. They are connected multiple synced channels to create complex graphs for real-time applications. Each node may provide a GUI or Graph for live interaction and visualization.

Any contribution is welcome! These projects take more time, than I can muster, so feel free to create issues for everything that you think might work better and feel free to create a MR for them as well!

Have fun and good coding!

## Installation

`pip install livenodes_qt --extra-index-url https://package_puller:8qYs4hBAsmAHJ5AdS_y9@gitlab.csl.uni-bremen.de/api/v4/groups/368/-/packages/pypi/simple`

## Docs

You can find the docs [here](https://livenodes.pages.csl.uni-bremen.de/packages/livenodes_qt/readme.html).

## Restrictions

None, just pure python and QT. Albeit, these make most sense when used with [Smart-Studio](https://livenodes.pages.csl.uni-bremen.de/smart-studio/readme.html).
